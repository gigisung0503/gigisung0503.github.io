# | Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Microgrids


Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and microgrids are related concepts in the energy sector, but with key differences:

**DER (Distributed Energy Resources):**

-   **Individual components:** DERs are individual technologies that generate, store, or manage energy at a local level, typically close to the point of use. Examples include:
    
    -   Rooftop solar panels
    -   Wind turbines
    -   Battery storage systems
    -   Combined heat and power (CHP) systems
    -   Electric vehicle chargers
-   **Grid connection:** DERs can be connected directly to the main electricity grid (on the customer side of the meter).
    
-   **Operation:** They typically operate in conjunction with the main grid, feeding power into it or drawing power from it as needed.
    

**Microgrid:**

-   **System of DERs:** A microgrid is a localized group of interconnected DERs that can operate autonomously (islanded mode) or connected to the main grid. It acts as a self-contained mini-grid.
-   **Components:** Microgrids can include any combination of DER technologies, along with control systems and switching mechanisms to manage power flow and maintain grid stability within the microgrid.
-   **Islanding capability:** The key distinction is that microgrids can disconnect from the main grid and continue to provide power to the local loads they serve during outages or grid disturbances. This offers increased resilience and reliability.

**Analogy:**

Think of DERs as individual building blocks, while a microgrid is a complete, self-sufficient (optional) mini-structure built from those blocks. A microgrid can include DERs, but not all DERs are part of a microgrid.
