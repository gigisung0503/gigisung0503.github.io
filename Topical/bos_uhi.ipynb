    "### Urban Heat Islands: A Growing Concern\n",
    "In the heart of Boston, as in many cities around the world, urban heat islands (UHIs) are a growing concern. These areas can be several degrees hotter than surrounding rural areas because buildings, roads, and pavement absorb and trap heat. This can worsen heatwaves, making them more intense and longer-lasting (Environmental Protection Agency, 2023). The good news is that there's a natural solution: urban green spaces like parks and blue spaces like rivers and lakes can help cool cities down. Studies have shown that these areas can significantly lower temperatures, providing much-needed relief during hot weather (The Nature Conservancy, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study Area\n",
    "#### Boston\n",
    "Boston, with its intricate blend of history and modernity, serves as a fascinating urban tapestry that showcases a unique convergence of architectural heritage, bustling commercial hubs, and lush green spaces. As the largest city in New England and one of the oldest cities in the United States, founded in 1630, Boston has evolved into a vibrant urban center that reflects a deliberate balance between development and preservation (Kennedy, 1994). The city's landscape is marked by a variety of land uses, presenting an intriguing mix of densely populated residential areas, thriving business districts, and significant historical sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central to Boston's urban green infrastructure is the Boston Common, the oldest city park in the United States, established in 1634. Alongside the adjacent Public Garden, it forms the heart of the city's green spaces, offering residents and visitors alike a verdant escape from the urban environment (Seasholes, 2003). Further enriching Boston's green landscape is the Emerald Necklace, a 1,100-acre chain of parks linked by parkways and waterways. Designed in the late 19th century by Frederick Law Olmsted, the father of American landscape architecture, this system of parks extends from Boston Common to Franklin Park, weaving through the city and exemplifying urban planning that integrates natural and built environments [^1]."

    "Moreover, Boston's geographical setting along the Massachusetts Bay, with the Charles River winding through the city, adds a critical blue dimension to its urban fabric. The Charles River Esplanade, an iconic park along the river's Boston bank, not only provides scenic beauty and recreational opportunities but also plays a vital role in the city's ecological health. The river itself has undergone significant restoration efforts, transforming it from a polluted waterway to a vibrant aquatic habitat and recreational resource, illustrating successful urban water management (EPA Charles River, 2020) [^2].

As such, examining the cooling effects of Boston's parks and water bodies can provide valuable insights into the role of urban green and blue spaces in mitigating the urban heat island effect, offering lessons that can be applied in other urban contexts.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "I adopted a methodology that combines Landsat8 satellite imagery and GIS data to assess ***the relationship between the proximity and size of green and blue spaces and urban temperatures*** in Boston. By drawing from and adapting the methodology of [Park Jong-Hwa & Cho Gi-Hyoug (2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310474426_Influence_of_park_size_on_the_park_cooling_effect_-_Focused_on_Ilsan_new_town_in_Korea), my study specifically focuses on Land Surface Temperature (LST) as the quantifiable measure of UHIs. Notably, I excluded Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data due to Boston’s relatively flat terrain and instead emphasized the importance of proximity to water bodies. Variables such as Land\n",
    "Use, NDVI, NDBI, and Albedo were controlled to isolate their effects on urban temperatures. My approach involves processing Landsat 8 satellite imagery to derive environmental indicators and reclassifying land use within Boston to understand how urban green and blue spaces impact urban heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, adopted was a comprehensive approach to understanding urban heat islands (UHIs) in Boston, employing satellite imagery and Massachusetts GIS databases. By calculating the distances from urban areas to these natural spaces and categorizing their sizes, I was able to  ***assess how proximity to and the size of parks and water bodies correlate with urban temperatures***. In other words, I used multi-regression model to explain how environmental and institutional factors contribute to UHI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, I focused on ***Land Surface Temperature (LST) as a quantifiable measure of UHIs***, drawing on the methodology established by *Park, Jong-Hwa, & Cho, Gi-Hyoug (2016)* in their  study [\"Influence of park size on the park cooling effect - Focused on Ilsan new town in Korea,\"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310474426_Influence_of_park_size_on_the_park_cooling_effect_-_Focused_on_Ilsan_new_town_in_Korea) published in the Journal of Korea Planning Association.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While this research is inspired by Park and Cho's (2016) investigation into the cooling effects of park size in Ilsan, South Korea, there are notable adaptations in this approach to suit the unique urban and geographical context of Boston. Unlike Ilsan, where variations in elevation (DEM - Digital Elevation Model data) play a significant role in the study due to the town's more pronounced topographical variations, ***Boston's relatively flat terrain led to omit DEM as a variable***. This decision was based on the understanding that Boston's elevation changes are not as drastic and are unlikely to significantly impact LST in the manner observed in Ilsan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this research expands the scope to ***include the influence of proximity to water bodies on urban cooling***, acknowledging the substantial role that urban blue spaces play alongside green spaces in mitigating heat. In doing so, this study recognize the unique characteristics of Boston's geography, particularly its adjacency to the Atlantic Ocean and the presence of significant water bodies such as the Charles River. However, I did ***not account for the size of water bodies*** in this analysis. The rationale behind this decision stems from the practical consideration that the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean and the variability in the size of local water bodies present challenges in quantifying their direct impact on LST using the same methodology applied to urban parks. Instead, the focus on distance from water bodies aims to capture the general cooling influence that proximity to blue spaces has on the urban thermal environment."

    "### Data Prep\n",
    "Utilizing satellite imagery and vector resources was instrumental in deriving key environmental indicators such as Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Albedo, alongside mapping the spatial distribution of water bodies and reclassifying land use within the study area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary data source was the Landsat 8 satellite, accessible via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which offers an extensive archive of global satellite imagery. For this study, I focused on imagery collected during the warmer months of May 1 to September 15, 2023, to capture the peak of the UHI effect. The Landsat 8 imagery, specifically the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data, provided the necessary spectral bands to calculate LST, NDVI, NDBI, and Albedo."

Through supervised classification techniques, I combined manually labeled training data representing urban, green, and water classes to develop a classification model. The classification  yielded a detailed land cover map, highlighting the distribution of water bodies, urban areas, and green spaces at a 30-meter resolution. The water pixels were then turned into polygon using ESRI's \"Raster to Polygon\" tool. In doing so, I could calculate the distance to water bodies from each grid cell using \"Near\" geoprocessing tool.\n",

This binning approach allows us to aggregate and analyze environmental data at a fine spatial resolution, corresponding to the Landsat 8 satellite imagery's resolution.
