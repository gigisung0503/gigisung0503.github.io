### Brief Biography
I am a geospatial analyst and urban planner driven by the belief that technology and data hold the power to transform cities into equitable, resilient, and sustainable spaces. At the World Health Organization, I lead projects that fuse satellite imagery and epidemiological data to address public health challenges, such as the relationship between climate change and disease seasonality in Yemen. I also contribute to national strategies, like Afghanistan's GIS roadmap, integrating geospatial tools to improve disease surveillance and emergency response systems.

My career spans diverse fields—urban mobility, climate resilience, and social equity—united by a commitment to harnessing technology for impactful governance. During my fellowship with the Bloomberg Center for Cities, I developed GIS-based solutions for informal settlements in South Africa, optimizing service delivery for underserved populations. At Harvard GSD, I combined technical innovation with research, analyzing pandemic-driven mobility shifts and creating tools to evaluate infrastructure vulnerabilities to climate hazards.

My vision is to shape technology governance in urban environments, ensuring that data and innovation are used not only to enhance efficiency but also to bridge gaps in equity and access. I believe emerging technologies must prioritize inclusivity, addressing the digital divide and empowering local communities through participatory frameworks. By leveraging tools like AI, GIS, and machine learning, I aim to foster urban systems that are not only intelligent but also just and adaptive to climate challenges.

As a technologist and urbanist, I bring a unique perspective, combining technical expertise with a deep understanding of social systems. With skills in Python, SQL, GIS, and machine learning, I strive to design solutions that serve as catalysts for positive change in smart city ecosystems.
