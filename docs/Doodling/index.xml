  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>오늘 저녁엔 오랜만에 파토와 통화를 했다. Monterray에서 가족과 연말 연시를 보내고 있고 곧 Mai와 San Diego로 이사간다 했다. 카이로보다 여덟시간 느리다는데 왜인지 새벽인가 싶을 정도로 잠이 덜깬, 목이 잠긴, 그리고 무척 피곤해보이는 파토를 보았다. 내 카이로 생활과 새로 시작한 일에대해서 두런두런 이야기를 나누다보니 내가 다 지겨워졌다. 으레 카이로라고하면 무슨 일이냐, 생활은 어떠냐, 음식은 잘 맞냐 등등 질문을 하기 때문에 ’Arab world’라는 방대한 컨텍스트를 채워야하는 수고스러움과 burden이 있다. 이제 십수번을 반복하고나니 말을 하면서 지겨워진다. 그리고 빨리 끝맺게 된다. 하지만 파토는 내가 정말 좋아했고 지금도 그립고 좋아하는 사람이라 오랜만에 최대한 공들여 대화를 했다.</p>
<p>파토는 새로운 사업을 시작하려한단다. 학교 다닐 때도 종종 듣던 그의 열정. “Sustainable city 디벨롭먼트네 투자하는 vehicle에서 일하고 싶다.” PE 에서 잡을 구할 줄 알았더니 결국은 사업을 시작하다니. 이곳 저곳 알아봤는데 자기가 찾는 프로필에 100퍼센트 부합하는 회사가 없다더라. 그래서 까짓거 회사를 그냥 시작해버리는 파토의 포부와 결단력!! 다시 한번 파토에게 느끼는 인간적인 매력과 끌림이 어디에 기원하는지 깨닫는다. 까먹기 전에 여기 적어놓자 Tecnológico de Monterrey의 City Center에서 샌디에고에서 멀지않은 멕시코 도시를 디벨롭한다고 한다. 파토의 회사는 아무래도 sustainability 를 맡아서 컨설팅을 하는 것 같다. 동업자인 그의 친구가 high performace building을 여럿 건설해본 경험이 있다고 한다. Developing countries context에서는 좀처럼 들어볼 수 없는 테크놀로지다. 여기서의 development는 humanitarian intervention 에 가깝기 때문에 기술 이전이라고 해도 정말 basic level에서부터 시작해야한다. 문득 leading discussion 이 일어나는 미국이 그러워졌다. 더불어 미국의 프라이빗 섹터에 갔으면 geospatial analyst로서의 일자체는 흥미로웠을 것이라는 민지언니의 코멘트가 떠올랐다.</p>
<p>끊임없이 곁눈질하는 나의 주특기가 발동한 것인지. 아니면 원래 커리어 패스에서 다른 옵션들을 끊임없이 생각해야하는건지. 내가 이상한건지 다른 사람도 같은건지… 여튼 파토도 지난 6개월간 시행착오와 많은 고민을 했다고 하니 위로는 되었다.</p>
<p>마지막으로 내 이별을 알게되었을 때 파토는 많이 놀란것 같았다. 자기는 10년전 쯤, 비람핀 여자친구 옆에 남는 것을 선택했는데 그때의 고통과 자괴감이 족히 5년은 더 자기를 괴롭혔다고 한다. 떠나는게 무서워서 붙잡은 관계가 결국은 자기를 더 망가트렸다고. 지지 너는 옳은 결정을 용기있게 한거라고. 순간 울컥해서 전화를 서둘러 끊었다. 이렇게 간만에 만나는 친구들에게 이별에 대해 이야기를 할 수 밖에 없는데. 왜냐하면 십중팔구 파트너에 대해 물어보기 때문에. 회차를 거듭할 수록 슬프지 않다는 사실을 근래에 깨달았다. 아! 정말 시간이 지나니까 나아지는구나. 내가 평생을 다시는 느낄 수 없을 것 같았던 분노와 절망이 희미해질 수 있는 감정이라는 사실에 새삼 놀란다. 뿐만 아니라 그 사건도 벌써 흐릿하고 그 시절도 애써 굳이 상기하지 않으면 벌써 기억하기 어렵다. 이렇게 덧없을 수가 있구나. 이 문장을 쓰고 더 잊기전에 document를 해놓아야하는가는 고민을 잠시했다. 아무래도 아니다. 굳이 그 어디에도 존재하지 않아도 되는 시간과 사람이다. 그런 의미에서 그 인간의 사진첩에서 모든 사진과 내 흔적을 지운 건 너무 잘한 일이다. 어째서인지, 아마도 방어기제겠지만, 그 인간의 얼굴이나 특징들이 이제 한순간에 떠오르지 않는다. 시간이 한참 걸리는데, 몇 가지 이벤트들은 너무 선명하다. 그냥 얼굴만 뭉그러져있을 뿐이다. 그리고 그 독특했던 목소리만 느낌으로 떠오른다. 기억하거나 추억할 모든 것을 남겨놓지 않고 지워버리는게 얼마나 무섭던지. 지금 생각하면 잘한 결정이다. 그리워할 것도 미워할 것도 대상이 있어야하는데 그게 없으니. 그냥 완벽한 구멍이 생겼다. 거기에 이것저것 채워넣다보니 그게 또 재밌네. 요즘은 이렇게 글쓰고, 책읽고, 러닝하다가 스쿼시도 하고. 많은 것들을 주워담고 있다. 다시 삶이 풍요로워지고 있다.</p>

<p><strong>Take This Waltz: Restlessness in Comfortable Love</strong></p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>Sarah Polley’s second feature film, <em>Take This Waltz</em>, dives into the uneasy space between affection, routine, and longing. Whereas her debut, <em>Away From Her</em>, told the story of an older couple facing Alzheimer’s, <em>Take This Waltz</em> focuses on a younger marriage quietly slipping into dissatisfaction. The result is a candid look at how even a seemingly happy relationship can push someone to crave something thrilling and new.</p>
<hr>
<section id="a-marriage-of-familiar-routines" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-marriage-of-familiar-routines">A Marriage of Familiar Routines</h3>
<p>Margot (Michelle Williams) and Lou (Seth Rogen) appear to have a pleasant, easygoing life. He’s a cookbook writer immersed in developing chicken recipes; she’s bright and imaginative. Their shared comfort suggests they’re doing just fine—until Margot meets Daniel (Luke Kirby). His spontaneity electrifies something in her that routine and security just can’t touch.</p>
<hr>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Polley uses quiet symbols to capture Margot’s state of mind. Lou’s endless chicken experiments point to his sincere yet predictable approach to life—steadfast but lacking surprise. Meanwhile, the Scrambler ride at a fairground stands in for Margot’s chaotic, head-spinning attraction to Daniel. As fun as it looks, it’s easy to end up dizzy and disoriented, unsure whether the rush truly solves anything or just repeats a familiar pattern with a new face.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="shifts-in-perspective" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="shifts-in-perspective">Shifts in Perspective</h3>
<p>Visually, Polley keeps us on our toes. Scenes that first appear to show Margot cooking for Lou might suddenly reveal she’s with Daniel instead, underlining how blurred the line can be between devotion and transgression. In one montage set to Leonard Cohen’s “Take This Waltz,” <strong>we watch Margot and Daniel’s relationship unfold in a rush—from its magnetic start to its sobering shift back into routine.</strong></p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="a-troubling-question" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-troubling-question">A Troubling Question</h3>
<p><strong>The core dilemma:</strong> <em style="color: #355C7D;">Is Margot’s restlessness about her marriage or about her own inability to settle down?</em> Lou is not cruel or neglectful—he’s genuinely caring, even a bit playful. Yet his unwavering stability may be part of what makes Margot itch to break free. Polley never labels Margot’s desire as “wrong” or “right.” Instead, she shows how people can drift away from good partners, lured by the promise of excitement—only to wonder if they’ll end up right where they started.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="why-it-resonates" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-resonates">Why It Resonates</h3>
<p>Ultimately, <em>Take This Waltz</em> shows how love can toggle between the comfort of the known and the spark of the unfamiliar. By the film’s end, there’s no tidy answer—only a reminder that longing can stem as much from within ourselves as it can from our circumstances. Polley leaves us reflecting on whether a new relationship is ever truly new, or if we keep recreating the same patterns in a different guise. It’s a thoughtful, lingering portrait of how the search for happiness might just circle back to the restlessness that sent us searching in the first place.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="a-personal-reflection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-personal-reflection">A Personal Reflection</h3>
<p>This film was a source of deep comfort for me. It also set me free from a lingering sense of guilt that had been weighing on me until quite recently. In my own past relationship, I was essentially in Lou’s position. From Margot’s perspective (or the director’s lens following Margot), Lou is portrayed as someone who values stability—almost to the point of seeming flat. I suspect that was a conscious choice in the film, a kind of cinematic compromise to underscore the contrast between Lou and Daniel.</p>
<p>Yet in my mind, Lou might be a far more sensitive soul than the film lets on. He could be the type who finds a sense of novelty in every small shift—whether it’s cooking chicken yet again or uttering the same “I love you” that others might find stale. Maybe those “boring” daily acts of affection felt fresh to Lou in subtle ways. Who knows? At least, that was my case.</p>
<p>Margot, however, seems to be tuned to a different frequency. To her, life with Lou feels like a cycle stuck on repeat, with no variation. Once Margot decides their marriage is “boring,” Lou’s every quality becomes monochromatic to her, as if she’s slipped a gray filter ovemr him. Interestingly, Daniel—Margot’s supposed alternative—turns out not to be the ideal she imagined. That part, oddly enough, gave me some solace.</p>
<p>I never truly learned why my own relationship had to end, though I suspect “boredom” was a major factor, and I ended up blaming myself for causing it. Seeing Margot’s endless restlessness hinted at in the film was a comfort. Realizing that someone like Margot—driven by impulses no one can fully quell—would struggle to find lasting contentment made me feel liberated. I may sound a bit twisted saying so.</p>
<p>That being said, I’d like to discuss moral (or could be ehtical) considerations w relationships in my next post. Will share more soon.</p>

  <title>Random Thoughts These Days</title>
  <dc:creator>Gigi Sung</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gigisung0503.github.io/Doodling/posts/2025-01-05.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>These days, I have been working and concentrating on spending quality alone time. I have been learning a lot, but I have not been able to write down my thoughts. Not because I haven’t had time to do so, but because I was sure that I would not commit myself to putting enough time and effort into fully capturing my emotions and thoughts. This is what I feel whenever I keep a journal. After some time, when I revisit the pieces, I am surprised by how flat and reduced the texts are, and I soon become deflated by the fact that the mediocre words have overwritten my rich feelings and thoughts. But regardless of the fact that my writing almost always fails to capture the sophisticated aspects of my thoughts, I still feel the need to write.</p>
<p>Or else, the only artifacts that I leave on Earth would be those of ChatGPT. I admit that the text prediction model is quite impressive, and most of the time, generates more concise and quintessential pieces. The texts are almost too perfect, meaning coherent and decisive, that they sound eerie. I wonder if “Uncanny Valley” is not only for visual representation but also for textual representation.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I plan to build muscles for writing. The muscles for reflection and spirituality. The muscles for keeping a record of all the bad and good things happening in my life. About things that drag me down and boost me up. About people who have shared love and people who have manipulated me.</p>

  <title>Open-source Alternatives to ArcGIS for Web Mapping</title>
  <dc:creator>Gigi Sung</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gigisung0503.github.io/Doodling/posts/2025-01-08-Map.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>When looking for open-source alternatives to Esri’s <code>ArcGIS</code> for serving web-based map applications, you’ll find a vibrant ecosystem of tools and frameworks. <strong><em>Some of these can fully replace <code>ArcGIS</code> in both data handling (server-side) and visualization (client-side)</em></strong>, while others focus on a specific slice of the mapping stack. Below is an overview of key open-source components commonly used to build a complete web mapping solution—from server to client.</p>
<hr>
<section id="client-side-libraries" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="client-side-libraries">1. Client-Side Libraries</h2>
<section id="leaflet" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="leaflet"><strong><code>Leaflet</code></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What It Is</strong>: A lightweight JavaScript library for interactive maps.</li>
<li><strong>Why It’s Great</strong>: Easy to learn, large plugin ecosystem, works well with raster tiles (e.g., from <code>Mapbox</code>, <code>OpenStreetMap</code>, or your own tile server).</li>
<li><strong>Typical Use Case</strong>: Quick prototypes or production apps that need simple, slippy maps with markers, pop-ups, and basic overlays.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="openlayers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="openlayers"><strong><code>OpenLayers</code></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What It Is</strong>: A more feature-rich JavaScript library for building advanced web maps.</li>
<li><strong>Why It’s Great</strong>: Offers broad support for geospatial formats (WMS, WMTS, vector tiles, etc.) and more complex GIS-like functionality out-of-the-box.</li>
<li><strong>Typical Use Case</strong>: Applications that need advanced map interactions, projections, and layers without heavy server-side customization.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="maplibre-gl" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maplibre-gl"><strong><code>MapLibre GL</code></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What It Is</strong>: An open-source fork of <code>Mapbox</code> GL JS (licensed under BSD). It provides client-side vector rendering in the browser.</li>
<li><strong>Why It’s Great</strong>: Retains the powerful style specification and performance of <code>Mapbox</code> GL, but free from the proprietary license constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Typical Use Case</strong>: Building highly interactive and customizable vector tile-based web apps with 3D capabilities and smooth zoom/rotation.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</section>
</section>
<section id="server-side-and-data-hosting" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="server-side-and-data-hosting">2. Server-Side and Data Hosting</h2>
<section id="geoserver" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geoserver"><strong><code>GeoServer</code></strong></h3>
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Typical Use Case</strong>: Serving vector/raster layers to web apps, enabling OGC-compliant services, or powering complex geospatial workflows.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="mapserver" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mapserver"><strong><code>MapServer</code></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What It Is</strong>: One of the oldest and most robust open-source map servers, written in C.</li>
<li><strong>Why It’s Great</strong>:
<ul>
<li>High performance in rendering cartographic maps.<br>
</li>
<li>Also supports OGC standards (WMS, WFS, WCS).<br>
</li>
<li>Lightweight and can be very fast if configured properly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Typical Use Case</strong>: Projects that need a stable and efficient map server for large datasets or high-traffic scenarios.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="qgis-server" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="qgis-server"><strong><code>QGIS</code> Server</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What It Is</strong>: The server component of the <code>QGIS</code> project (an open-source desktop GIS).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Why It’s Great</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Uses <code>QGIS</code>’s own rendering engine, meaning the same styling you create in <code>QGIS</code> Desktop can be served to the web.<br>
</li>
<li>Supports OGC standards (WMS, WFS).<br>
</li>
<li>Seamless integration with <code>QGIS</code> Desktop, making it convenient to publish layers directly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Typical Use Case</strong>: Organizations already using <code>QGIS</code> Desktop who want an easier path to publish maps with the same styling online.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>What It Is</strong>: An open-source Node.js server that hosts vector tiles (MBTiles or raw data) and serves them via styles compatible with <code>Mapbox</code>/MapLibre.</li>
<li><strong>Why It’s Great</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Easy to set up a self-hosted vector tile service.<br>
</li>
<li>Works nicely with <code>MapLibre GL</code> or <code>Mapbox</code> GL JS front-ends.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Typical Use Case</strong>: When you want full control over your vector tiles or an offline map environment.</li>
</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section id="data-sources-and-basemaps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-sources-and-basemaps">4. Data Sources and Basemaps</h2>
<p>While you can use your own data, you might also need base layers or geocoding/routing services. Many open-source projects rely on <strong><code>OpenStreetMap</code></strong> data, which is crowdsourced and free. You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-host</strong> your own OSM-based tiles with tools like <strong>OpenMapTiles</strong> or <strong>TileServer GL</strong>, or<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Use a third-party service</strong> (e.g., MapTiler, Carto, or <code>Mapbox</code>—though <code>Mapbox</code> is free up to certain usage limits but not fully open-source).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="putting-it-all-together" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="putting-it-all-together">5. Putting It All Together</h2>
<p>A typical fully open-source web GIS “stack” might look like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Data Storage</strong>: <code>PostGIS</code> (for vector data), GeoTIFFs or other rasters on disk.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Map Server</strong>: <code>GeoServer</code> or <code>MapServer</code> to publish data via WMS/WMTS (raster layers) or WFS (vector data).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Frontend</strong>: <code>Leaflet</code>, <code>OpenLayers</code>, or <code>MapLibre GL</code> to render maps in the browser and provide interactive features.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Styling and Tiles</strong>: Optionally use TileServer GL or <code>QGIS</code> Server for vector/raster tile services with custom cartography.</li>
</ol>
<p>This setup can replicate much of <code>ArcGIS</code>’s map serving functionality without the licensing costs. You do, however, shoulder more responsibility for setup, security, scalability, and maintenance.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="how-do-these-tools-compare-to-arcgis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-do-these-tools-compare-to-arcgis">6. How Do These Tools Compare to <code>ArcGIS</code>?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Cost</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Open-source</strong> solutions are generally free to use (though you may pay for hosting and developer time).<br>
</li>
<li><strong><code>ArcGIS</code></strong> typically requires license fees, which can be significant for large deployments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Open-source</strong> stacks let you customize every layer of the system—ideal if you have specific or niche requirements.<br>
</li>
<li><strong><code>ArcGIS</code></strong> provides a well-integrated ecosystem of desktop, online, and enterprise tools, but can be less flexible outside Esri’s ecosystem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Community &amp; Support</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Open-source</strong> communities (<code>GeoServer</code>, <code>MapServer</code>, <code>QGIS</code>, <code>Leaflet</code>, etc.) are large and active. Premium support can come from third-party consultants or in-house experts.<br>
</li>
<li><strong><code>ArcGIS</code></strong> offers official Esri support, training, and extensive documentation, which some organizations prefer for mission-critical deployments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Advanced GIS Functions</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>ArcGIS</code></strong> has built-in advanced tools (e.g., network analysis, 3D, big data analytics) that can be convenient.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Open-source</strong> solutions often require combining multiple tools (e.g., GRASS GIS, <code>PostGIS</code>, Python libraries) to achieve the same functionality. This modularity is powerful but adds complexity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="including-mapbox-in-the-conversation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="including-mapbox-in-the-conversation">7. Including <code>Mapbox</code> in the Conversation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Mapbox</code></strong> itself is not fully open-source (the <code>Mapbox</code> platform is commercial), but many of its underlying components—like [<code>Mapbox</code> GL JS v1 (BSD-licensed up to a certain version)] and <a href="https://github.com/%60mapbox%60/tile-reduce">TileReduce</a>—were open-source or open-core.<br>
</li>
<li><strong><code>MapLibre GL</code></strong> has emerged as a fully open-source alternative that continues the vector rendering engine in a community-led fashion.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re comfortable mixing open-source with commercial APIs, <code>Mapbox</code> can be an excellent choice for basemaps, geocoding, and styling—especially if you’re not subject to strict open-source mandates. Otherwise, <code>MapLibre GL</code> plus self-hosted tile services (via TileServer GL or <code>GeoServer</code>) can fulfill a truly open-source pipeline.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Building an open-source web GIS stack requires piecing together various components for data storage (<code>PostGIS</code>), map serving (<code>GeoServer</code>, <code>MapServer</code>, <code>QGIS</code> Server), and frontend visualization (<code>Leaflet</code>, <code>OpenLayers</code>, or <code>MapLibre GL</code>). While <code>ArcGIS</code> offers a one-stop, proprietary solution, open-source alternatives can be just as robust, infinitely flexible, and cost-effective—provided you have the technical expertise (or are willing to learn) to configure and maintain them.</p>
<p>In short, if you’re looking to replace <code>ArcGIS</code> for web-serving map applications with purely open-source tools (including MapLibre/<code>Mapbox</code>-like clients), you’ll find a rich, supportive community and a powerful suite of technologies ready to be tailored to your specific project needs.</p>
