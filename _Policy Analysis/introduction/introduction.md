# Introduction to Public Policy Analytics

## Introduction
- **Summary:** The foundation of successful public-sector data science is domain expertise, not just technical skills. Understanding the decision-making process and its consequences is crucial for a more evidence-based approach.

## Context as the Foundation
- **Summary:** The book uses 'use cases' to drive the development of technology solutions, emphasizing the importance of context in designing effective programs and policies. Understanding the policy, programs, program efficacy, and delivery methods is essential for impactful data science in government.

## Data Science as a Planning Tool
- **Summary:** Data science is related to planning in terms of allocating limited resources effectively. The book focuses on predictive modeling and machine learning to inform decision-making and planning, with an emphasis on social costs and fairness.

## The Importance of Spatial Thinking
- **Summary:** Spatial processes and patterns are crucial in understanding social science phenomena. The book delves into spatial analysis, exploring concepts like dispersion, clustering, and the challenges of scale.

## Learning Objectives
- **Summary:** The book aims to provide context and code for public sector data scientists and policymakers, using Python as the programming language. It covers both descriptive and predictive data science, with a focus on geospatial machine learning and algorithmic fairness.

### Chapters Overview
- **Chapter 1:** Introduction to Python and exploratory spatial analysis.
- **Chapter 2:** Geoprocessing and town selection for development rights using Python.
- **Chapters 3-4:** Geospatial machine learning for forecasting home prices using Python.
- **Chapter 5:** Geospatial risk prediction and the perils of predictive policing using Python.
- **Chapter 6:** Person-based predictive models focusing on churn using Python.
- **Chapter 7:** Assessing algorithmic fairness in person-level predictions using Python.
- **Chapter 8:** Forecasting space/time rideshare demand using geospatial machine learning with Python.
- **Conclusion:** Connecting algorithmic themes with traditional planning practice and introducing the 'Algorithmic Governance' framework, with a focus on Python implementation.

### Additional Resources
- The blog series will provide Python code examples and adaptations of the concepts discussed in the book. Open data and code will be available on GitHub, and assignments will be provided for each chapter to apply the learned concepts using Python.
