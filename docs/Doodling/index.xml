<p>Sarah Polley’s second feature film, <em>Take This Waltz</em>, dives into the uneasy space between affection, routine, and longing. Whereas her debut, <em>Away From Her</em>, told the story of an older couple facing Alzheimer’s, <em>Take This Waltz</em> focuses on a younger marriage quietly slipping into dissatisfaction. The result is a candid look at how even a seemingly happy relationship can push someone to crave something thrilling and new.</p>

<p>Margot (Michelle Williams) and Lou (Seth Rogen) appear to have a pleasant, easygoing life. He’s a cookbook writer immersed in developing chicken recipes; she’s bright and imaginative. Their shared comfort suggests they’re doing just fine—until Margot meets Daniel (Luke Kirby). His spontaneity electrifies something in her that routine and security just can’t touch.</p>

<p>Polley uses quiet symbols to capture Margot’s state of mind. Lou’s endless chicken experiments point to his sincere yet predictable approach to life—steadfast but lacking surprise. Meanwhile, the Scrambler ride at a fairground stands in for Margot’s chaotic, head-spinning attraction to Daniel. As fun as it looks, it’s easy to end up dizzy and disoriented, unsure whether the rush truly solves anything or just repeats a familiar pattern with a new face.</p>

<p>Visually, Polley keeps us on our toes. Scenes that first appear to show Margot cooking for Lou might suddenly reveal she’s with Daniel instead, underlining how blurred the line can be between devotion and transgression. In one montage set to Leonard Cohen’s “Take This Waltz,” <strong>we watch Margot and Daniel’s relationship unfold in a rush—from its magnetic start to its sobering shift back into routine.</strong></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-troubling-question">A Troubling Question</h3>
<p><strong>The core dilemma:</strong> <em style="color: #355C7D;">Is Margot’s restlessness about her marriage or about her own inability to settle down?</em> Lou is not cruel or neglectful—he’s genuinely caring, even a bit playful. Yet his unwavering stability may be part of what makes Margot itch to break free. Polley never labels Margot’s desire as “wrong” or “right.” Instead, she shows how people can drift away from good partners, lured by the promise of excitement—only to wonder if they’ll end up right where they started.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-resonates">Why It Resonates</h3>
<p>Ultimately, <em>Take This Waltz</em> shows how love can toggle between the comfort of the known and the spark of the unfamiliar. By the film’s end, there’s no tidy answer—only a reminder that longing can stem as much from within ourselves as it can from our circumstances. Polley leaves us reflecting on whether a new relationship is ever truly new, or if we keep recreating the same patterns in a different guise. It’s a thoughtful, lingering portrait of how the search for happiness might just circle back to the restlessness that sent us searching in the first place.</p>
<p><span style="color: #355C7D;"> Below is a personal note I’d like to add, reflecting on how <em>Take This Waltz</em> resonated with my own experiences and emotions:</span></p>

<section id="a-personal-reflection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-personal-reflection">A Personal Reflection</h3>
<p>This film was a source of deep comfort for me. It also set me free from a lingering sense of guilt that had been weighing on me until quite recently. In my own past relationship, I was essentially in Lou’s position. From Margot’s perspective (or the director’s lens following Margot), Lou is portrayed as someone who values stability—almost to the point of seeming flat. I suspect that was a conscious choice in the film, a kind of cinematic compromise to underscore the contrast between Lou and Daniel.</p>
<p>Yet in my mind, Lou might be a far more sensitive soul than the film lets on. He could be the type who finds a sense of novelty in every small shift—whether it’s cooking chicken yet again or uttering the same “I love you” that others might find stale. Maybe those “boring” daily acts of affection felt fresh to Lou in subtle ways. Who knows? At least, that’s how I see myself.</p>
<p>Margot, however, seems to be tuned to a different frequency. To her, life with Lou feels like a cycle stuck on repeat, with no variation. Once Margot decides their marriage is “boring,” Lou’s every quality becomes monochromatic to her, as if she’s slipped a gray filter over him. Interestingly, Daniel—Margot’s supposed alternative—turns out not to be the ideal she imagined. That part, oddly enough, gave me some solace.</p>
<p>I never truly learned why my own relationship had to end, though I suspect “boredom” was a major factor, and I ended up blaming myself for causing it. Seeing Margot’s endless restlessness hinted at in the film was a comfort. Realizing that someone like Margot—driven by impulses no one can fully quell—would struggle to find lasting contentment made me feel liberated. I may sound a bit twisted, but that’s honestly how I feel.</p>

  <title>Random Thoughts in These Days</title>
  <dc:creator>Gigi Sung</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>These days, I have been working and concentrating on spending quality alone time. I have been learning a lot, but I have not been able to write down my thoughts. Not because I haven’t had time to do so, but because I was sure that I would not commit myself to putting enough time and effort into fully capturing my emotions and thoughts. This is what I feel whenever I keep a journal. After some time, when I revisit the pieces, I am surprised by how flat and reduced the texts are, and I soon become deflated by the fact that the mediocre words have overwritten my rich feelings and thoughts. But regardless of the fact that my writing almost always fails to capture the sophisticated aspects of my thoughts, I still feel the need to write.</p>
<p>Or else, the only artifacts that I leave on Earth would be those of ChatGPT. I admit that the text prediction model is quite impressive, and most of the time, generates more concise and quintessential pieces. The texts are almost too perfect, meaning coherent and decisive, that they sound eerie. I wonder if “Uncanny Valley” is not only for visual representation but also for textual representation.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I plan to build muscles for writing. The muscles for reflection and spirituality. The muscles for keeping a record of all the bad and good things happening in my life. About things that drag me down and boost me up. About people who have shared love and people who have manipulated me.</p>
