[The OECD Programme on Smart Cities and Inclusive Growth](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/the-oecd-programme-on-smart-cities-and-inclusive-growth0.html)

The OECD Programme on Smart cities and Inclusive Growth supports governments in leveraging digital technologies to boost citizens’ well-being and deliver more efficient, sustainable, and inclusive urban environments.


[OECD Roundtable on Smart Cities and Inclusive Growth](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/the-oecd-programme-on-smart-cities-and-inclusive-growth0/oecd-roundtable-on-smart-cities-and-inclusive-growth.html)

The OECD Roundtable on Smart Cities and Inclusive Growth gathers stakeholders from around the world to share policies, practices and knowledge on how to get smart city initiatives right.

The Roundtable brings together key stakeholders from cities, regions, national governments, the private sector, civil society, academia, philanthropy and international organisations to:

- Learn from a common understanding of the concept of smart cities across the globe and raise awareness on the policy implications for inclusive growth;
- Share policies, practices and knowledge on how to get smart city initiatives right, and shape the way to upscale success stories and minimise risks;
- Advance the data measurement agenda to co-produce an analytical and indicator framework to assess the smart cities’ performance and their contribution to inclusive growth;
- Understand opportunities and challenges related to the disruptions of digital innovation on city governance, data ownership and disclosure, private sector participation, and citizen engagement;
- Raise awareness of the potential of digital technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence [AI], Internet of Things [IoT], Big Data), and supporting digital infrastructure and devices (e.g. wireless broadband networks, smartphones and cloud computing) to foster innovation and deliver public services more efficiently and effectively.
