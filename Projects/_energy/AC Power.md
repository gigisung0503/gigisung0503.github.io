Power grids primarily use AC (Alternating Current) power for several key historical and practical reasons:

**1. Efficient Long-Distance Transmission**

- **Transformers are the Key:** One of AC's biggest advantages is the ease of changing voltage levels using transformers. ==When electricity is transported over long distances, transformers step up the voltage to very high levels, reducing losses due to resistance in the wires. At the destination, transformers easily step the voltage back down for safer use.==
- **DC's Limitation:** DC power transmission was far less efficient back in the early era of power grids. Changing DC voltage required complex and expensive equipment, making long-distance transmission impractical.

**2. Early Generator Design**

- **AC's Natural Generation:** ==The rotating generators used in most power plants (whether hydroelectric, coal, or nuclear) naturally produce AC electricity.== Converting this to DC would have been an extra, costly step in the early days of the power grid.

**3. AC Motors**

- **Industrial Power:** AC power enabled the development of simple and robust electric motors (particularly induction motors) These were crucial for driving industrial machinery, revolutionizing manufacturing.
- **DC Motor Limitations:** While DC motors exist, they often require more complex design and maintenance for large-scale applications.

**Why Didn't We Switch Later?**

- **Inertia of Infrastructure:** AC technology became deeply embedded in power generation, transmission, and consumer appliances. Switching to DC later on would have been massively expensive.
- **Advances in Power Electronics:** Modern power electronics have made DC transmission more viable for some long-distance projects, particularly when linking grids that operate at different frequencies. However, on the larger scale, AC remains the backbone of distribution systems.

**In Summary:** AC's combination of efficient transmission, early generator design, and its role in powering industrial motors meant it won out over DC in the early days of the power grid and the infrastructure built around it made switching impractical.
