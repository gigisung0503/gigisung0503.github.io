I am going to write a research paper(about 20 pages) on application of digital twins in climate mitigation and  adaptation at a city level. I want to include:

1. concept of digital twins (in the broader realm of digital transformation)
2. landscape of the digital twins worldwide (case studies, applications, etc.)
   1. worldwide trends and examples
   2. initiatives in the us cities
   3. application of digital twins in climate mitigation and adaptation at a city level: why it is important to bringing in the integrated resource/platform and how it can help
3. Challenges faced by the us cities in adopting digital twins for climate mitigation and adaptation at a city level
   1. resource constraints
   2. data privacy and security
   3. lack of technical expertise
   4. lack of awareness
4. Proposals for overcoming the challenges
