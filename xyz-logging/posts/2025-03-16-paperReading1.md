## Overview (Directly scraped from the WHO website)
The Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS)[^1] aims to provide decision-makers and health stakeholders with vital, up-to-date information. This system is dedicated to monitoring <mark>the availability of critical health resources and services</mark>, thus playing a crucial role in identifying existing gaps and establishing intervention priorities.   

The HeRAMS accessibility models have been developed to improve understanding of the complexities of health service coverage and barriers to their delivery. Combining data on service availability, barriers to provision, spatial models of physical accessibility, and gridded population data, HeRAMS accessibility models introduce a novel set of indicators to measure populationsâ€™ access to health services. Thus, providing further insights to decision-makers involved in the prioritization of needs and interventions as well as in measuring their impact.

This report presents the results of the HeRAMS accessibility models to essential health services for 11 priority oblast (Chernihivska, Donetska, Dnipropetrovska, Kharkivska, Khersonska, Kyiv metropolitan area, Kyivska, Mykolaivska, Odeska, Poltavska, Sumska, and Zaporizka) in Ukraine, and is based on data reported in HeRAMS as of January 2nd, 2024. It is important to note that the deployment of HeRAMS is ongoing, including data verification and validation. Consequently, this analysis is not final and was produced solely for the purpose of informing operations.
