<!-- ### Brief Biography
I am a **geospatial analyst and urban planner** committed to leveraging technology and data to build equitable, resilient, and sustainable urban systems. At the **World Health Organization**, I lead projects combining satellite imagery and epidemiological data to confront public health challenges, including the **climateâ€“disease** nexus in Yemen and GIS-driven emergency response strategies in Afghanistan.

My experience spans urban mobility, **climate resilience**, and social equity, culminating in a fellowship with the Bloomberg Center for Cities to deploy GIS-based solutions in South Africaâ€™s informal settlements. At Harvard GSD, I integrated research with technical innovationâ€”analyzing pandemic-driven mobility shifts and evaluating infrastructure vulnerabilities to climate hazards.

I believe that inclusive **technology governance** is critical in urban development. By prioritizing local participation and bridging the **digital divide**, emerging toolsâ€”such as AI, GIS, and machine learningâ€”can be harnessed to create smart city ecosystems that are not only efficient but equitable. Drawing on Python, SQL, GIS, and ML, I aim to craft data-driven solutions that serve as catalysts for positive urban transformation. -->



### Tracker Dashboard, the World Bank
I find this World Bank tracker dashboard very useful... Something that we could adopt at WHO EMROðŸ¤”, including all the long-term/emergency programs. 
460 projects with $72.6b commit amount over the span of 109 countries...!
