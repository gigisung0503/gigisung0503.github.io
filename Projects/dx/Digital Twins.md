**Definition**

- **A digital twin** is a virtual replica of a physical asset, process, or system that is continuously updated with real-time data using sensors and other data sources.expand_more
- It goes beyond basic 3D models or simulations.expand_more A digital twin is a dynamic, living representation that mirrors the real-world counterpart.expand_more
- **Key components:**
    - Physical object/system
    - Data collection mechanism (sensors, IoT, etc.)
    - Virtual model
    - Two-way connection between the physical and virtual for continuous updates and data-driven insights.expand_more

**History**

- **Early Concepts (1990s-early 2000s):** Ideas of mirroring physical systems in a virtual environment emerged in product lifecycle management (PLM) and manufacturing.
- **Term Coining (2002):** The term "digital twin" is attributed to Dr. Michael Grieves in a presentation on PLM.expand_more
- **Technological Advancements (2010s-present):** Growth of IoT, cloud computing, big data analytics, and AI fuels digital twin capabilities:
    - Increased data availability
    - More powerful simulations
    - Real-time monitoring and control

**Digital Twins in City Planning**

Digital twins are increasingly used in city planning due to their potential to:

- **Integrated Understanding:** Digital twins create a central platform for city data (infrastructure, transportation, energy, environment, etc.), breaking down silos.
- **Scenario Planning and Simulation:** Test policy changes, infrastructure projects, or responses to disruptions (e.g., extreme weather) in a virtual environment before real-world implementation.expand_more
- **Optimization:** Improve decision-making for resource allocation, urban development, and service delivery.expand_more
- **Enhanced Resilience:** Proactively assess climate risks, plan for mitigation and adaptation strategies.expand_more
- **Public Engagement:** Visualizations help inform and engage citizens in planning processes.

**Current State of the Technology**

- **Still evolving:** Digital twins for cities are a relatively new but rapidly expanding field.expand_more
- **Successful Examples:**
    - Singapore: Virtual Singapore for urban planningexpand_more
    - Rotterdam: Digital twin for flood management
    - Numerous cities piloting projects in transportation, energy management, and building efficiency.
- **Challenges:**
    - Cost and complexity
    - Data integration and standardization
    - Cybersecurity concerns

**Future Outlook**

Digital twins have the potential to play a crucial role in smart city development and in addressing critical urban challenges like climate change. As the technology matures, we expect even greater integration and adoption in city planning worldwide.
