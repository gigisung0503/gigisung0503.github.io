<section id="what-is-your-impression-of-south-africa" class="level1">
<h1>What is your impression of South Africa?</h1>
<p>“So, what is your impression of South Africa so far?” <br><br></p>
<p>This is the first question I get asked whenever I meet someone here in uMngeni. And I give the most unremarkable answer one could imagine: <br><br></p>
<p>“Ahh, it’s almost the same as the States.” <br><br></p>
<p>Then comes the confused look. They might think, “What is she talking about? South Africa is nothing like the States. She’s Asian. She mustn’t have been in America for that long.” That’s a fair guess. I’ve lived in the States for two and a half years now. Boston, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle are the only cities I’ve visited.</p>
<p>Regardless, my argument remains the same. South Africa is almost the same as the States, and the rest of the “developing” world. The work of capital and the way of business are the same, hense the same look of development. You realize how true the word “globalization” is that you get a shiver.</p>
<p>“Developing” countries, like South Africa, and South Korea a few decades ago, are burdened with obssesive imperative to close the gap with the “developed” world. The “developed” world fuel this obsession by providing loans, investments, and technologies. And they make sure that the “developing” countries are on the right track by dispatching their experts and consultants like me.</p>
<p>Yeah. That is what I am doing. I am an embassador with a mission to implant the same protocols and business conventions as accepted by the “developed” world. At the end of this mission, a bigger, more efficient, and more profitable market with “educated” consumers awaits the “developed” world.</p>
<p>I say this with a touch of sarcasm but without criticism. It is as natural as white ants expanding their colonies. There is no value judgment here. I don’t believe there’s an alternative way of being in this humanity. You either colonize or get colonized. You either set the rules or follow the rules. It is sad, though, that the “rules” are now the same everywhere.</p>
<p>Returning to the question, “What is your impression of South Africa?” You now understand how my answer makes sense. South Africa is almost the same as the States. It is a place where the same rules apply. It is a place where the same marathon is run. It’s just that South Africa and our fellow once-colonized-and-now-developing countries are many steps behind.</p>
<p>“Then, what about humanitarian work?” You might ask, thinking that it is with noble cause, not hiding any insidious scheme behind, different from the “development missionary.” I also acknowledge that a set of humanitarian inteventions is with impricable motive/value. But really, there is a fine line between humanitarian and development work in the field. Development gives access to water, electricity, and education, a better life. The time of execution is a differentiater. The results are the same.</p>
</section>
<section id="indigent-policy-program" class="level1">
<h1>Indigent Policy Program</h1>
<p>Now, that was a heavy introduction. You still do not know why I am in SA. I am here as a consultant hired by Harvard Bloomberg Cities Leadership Initiative. Within the timeline of 10 weeks, I investigate, diagnose, and prescribe a solution to the indigent policy program in uMngeni. May be that is too broad.</p>

  <title>Detecting Informal Settlements with Satellite Imagery</title>
  <dc:creator>Gigi Sung</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gigisung0503.github.io/Posts/posts/informal_settlement.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>While your intentions to provide quality public service may be commendable, achieving this goal requires an accurate demographic, socioeconomic, and sptial data. Understanding where people live, who they are, what they do, and how much they earn is fundamental to the functioning of a modern state. Regardless of whether the state should be the sole authority to produce this knowledge, the provision of basic services like electricity, water, and waste collection faces significant delays without a proper understanding of the population.</p>
<p>As with many other parts of the world, recognizing the spatial, let alone demographics and socioeconomic, distribution of informal settlements is a major challenge for eThekwini, the municipality with the largest number of informal settlements in South Africa. Rapid urbanization and limited available land exacerbate this issue. To address it, the city has launched initiatives like the <strong>Informal Settlement Information Management Solution (ISIMS)</strong> and has partnered with <em>UNITAC</em> Hamburg to enhance data management. This collaboration uses machine learning and aerial imagery to accelerate the spatial recognition of informal settlements.</p>
<p>Learn more about this initiative:</p>

<pre class="prompt"><code>#### Article Text:

[Insert the full text of the provided article here]


#### Research Project Description:

Analyzing changes in human mobility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on travel behavior before and after the pandemic across different regions and socio-economic groups. 




#### Key Insights:
1. **Insight 1**: Increased use of urban green spaces in higher GDP regions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - **Citation**: "The GDP per capita of studied locations also played a role in the direction of changes in UGS use: locations with higher GDP per capita were more likely to experience an increase in UGS use than locations with a lower GDP per capita."

2. **Insight 2**: Stricter COVID-19 policies correlated with decreased use of public parks.
   - **Citation**: "The stringency of COVID-19 policies had a negative impact on UGS use during and after the first lockdowns... A weighted logistic regression revealed that locations reporting decreased use had significantly higher COVID-19 governance stringency."

3. **Insight 3**: Socio-economic disparities influenced the ability to adopt social distancing behaviors.
   - **Citation**: "Low-income and minority communities, facing cascading health challenges, are found to be least able to modify mobility behavior and therefore experienced a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 infection risk during the first wave of the pandemic."

#### Relevance to Research Project:
- **Relevance 1**: The finding that higher GDP regions saw increased use of green spaces aligns with the project's aim to analyze travel behavior changes based on socio-economic factors, highlighting how wealthier areas adapted differently.
- **Relevance 2**: The correlation between strict COVID-19 policies and decreased park use provides insight into how policy stringency influenced mobility, relevant for comparing regions with varying restrictions.
- **Relevance 3**: Understanding that socio-economic disparities impacted mobility behavior adoption is crucial for the project's focus on different socio-economic groups, emphasizing the need to consider inequality in behavioral responses.

#### LinkedIn Post:

🚶‍♂️🌳 **Urban Green Spaces and COVID-19: A Study on Usage Patterns and Socio-Economic Disparities** 🌳🚶‍♀️

A recent study highlights significant changes in the use of urban green spaces (UGS) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key findings include:

1. **Higher GDP, Higher Usage**: Regions with higher GDP per capita saw increased use of UGS, emphasizing the role of economic conditions in adapting to the pandemic.
2. **Policy Impact**: Stricter COVID-19 policies were linked to decreased use of public parks, reflecting how governance stringency influenced outdoor activities.
3. **Socio-Economic Disparities**: Low-income and minority communities faced greater challenges in adopting social distancing behaviors, leading to higher infection risks.

These insights underscore the importance of considering economic and social factors in urban planning and public health strategies.

<h1>ETL Convention</h1>
<p>To construct an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, it’s essential to follow a structured approach that ensures data is efficiently moved from source systems to a destination system, typically a data warehouse. Here is a detailed convention for building an ETL pipeline:</p>
<p>The following table shows the key libraries used in a typical Python-based ETL pipeline:</p>

<p>The search API allows you to look up a location from a textual description or address. Nominatim supports structured and free-form search queries.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The search query may also contain <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Special_Phrases">special phrases</a> which are translated into specific OpenStreetMap (OSM) tags (e.g.&nbsp;Pub =&gt; <code>amenity=pub</code>). This can be used to narrow down the kind of objects to be returned.</p>
