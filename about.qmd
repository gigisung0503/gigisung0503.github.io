Hello, my name is Gigi Sung, and I am a **geospatial analyst** and **urban planner** dedicated to leveraging technology and data for equitable, resilient, and sustainable urban development. As a graduate of the **Harvard Graduate School of Design** and an analyst at the **World Health Organization**, I operate at the intersection of cutting-edge research and impactful real-world applications, employing **spatial data science** to address critical public health challenges—ranging from climate–disease dynamics in Yemen to GIS-driven emergency response strategies in Afghanistan.

My passion lies in **machine learning and deep learning** for urban planning, encompassing areas like land use classification, building footprint extraction, and urban growth prediction. I also recognize the **indispensable role of statistical models** in complementing algorithmic approaches, ensuring robust quantitative insights. In the realm of climate action, I focus on risk assessments, urban heat island mitigation, and identifying optimal renewable energy sites, all of which advance more adaptable and livable cities.

I firmly believe in **open data and open-source solutions** as catalysts for democratizing analytics and fostering collective progress. At the same time, my work emphasizes balancing quantitative rigor with qualitative understanding—grounding data-driven insights in the human context that shapes urban life. By integrating both analytical depth and empathetic awareness, I aim to develop strategies and frameworks that not only innovate but also include and empower the communities they serve.
