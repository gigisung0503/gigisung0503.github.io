**In Physics and Electrical Systems:**

- **The rate of repeating cycles:** Frequency measures how many times a wave (which could be a sound wave, light wave, or an alternating current in a power grid) completes a full cycle in one second.
- **Unit of measurement: Hertz (Hz)** One Hertz means one cycle per second. For example, a power grid operating at 60 Hz means the alternating current flowing through it changes direction 60 times each second.

**Why Frequency Matters in Power Grids:**

1. **Synchronization:** ==All generators connected to a power grid must operate at the same frequency.== If they aren't synchronized, it creates instability and can damage equipment.
2. **Appliance Compatibility:** ==Most electrical appliances and devices are designed to operate at a specific frequency (usually either 50Hz or 60Hz, depending on your region)==. Mismatched frequencies can cause appliances to malfunction or get damaged.
3. **Grid Stability:** Grid operators carefully monitor frequency. ==Deviations from the standard frequency indicate an imbalance between power generation and consumption.==

An oversupply of electricity on the power grid will tend to increase the frequency. Here's why:

- **[[AC Power]] and Frequency:** Power grids use alternating current (AC), where the direction of the electrical flow changes many times per second. This rate of change is the frequency, typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz, depending on your country.
    
- **Linked to Generator Speed:**  ==In a traditional power plant, large rotating turbines generate electricity. The speed of these turbines is directly linked to the frequency of the AC electricity produced.==
    
- **Oversupply Means Less Resistance:**  When too much electricity is being produced relative to the demand, it's as if there's less resistance in the grid. This allows the generators to spin a bit more easily and faster. 
    
- **Increased Frequency:** ==This slightly increased generator speed directly translates into a slightly higher frequency of the electricity being produced.==
    

**Important Considerations:**

- **Safety Limits:** Power grids have strict limits on how much the frequency can deviate from the standard (e.g., 50 Hz or 60 Hz). ==Grid operators actively take steps to prevent large frequency increases.==
- **Automatic Responses:** Power plants have automatic systems that reduce their output if the frequency rises too high, helping to stabilize the grid.
