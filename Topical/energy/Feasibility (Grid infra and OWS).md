Here are a few real-world examples of how grid infrastructure impacts the feasibility of offshore wind (OSW) projects:

**Case 1: Germany's Delayed Ambitions**

- **Strong OSW Goals:** Germany is a leading force in European OSW development with ambitious targets to expand capacity.expand_more
- ==**Grid Bottleneck==:** However, ***transmission infrastructure*** in Northern Germany, close to many of its North Sea wind farms, hasn't kept pace. ==This congested grid creates delays as OSW projects struggle to connect and deliver their generated power to population centers.==
- **Consequences:** ==The slow expansion of grid infrastructure== has hindered the full realization of Germany's offshore wind power potential.

**Case 2: UK's Early Investment Pays Off**

- **Proactive Approach:** In anticipation of growing OSW capacity, the UK invested heavily in ==upgrading their coastal grid infrastructure== specifically targeting integration with offshore wind farms.
- **Positive Results:** These investments have made connecting and transmitting energy from OSW farms much smoother, enabling the UK to harness its vast offshore wind resources more efficiently.

**Case 3: Texas, USA - A Lesson in Limits**

- **Wind Power Boom:** Texas experienced a rapid increase in onshore wind capacity, especially in West Texas.
- ==**Transmission Bottleneck==:** The existing grid wasn't designed to handle the influx of energy from remote wind farms. This led to periods of wasted wind power, where turbines had to be shut down because transmission lines were at capacity.[expand_more](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wind-power/wind-energy-wasted-in-grid-constrained-texas/)
- **Consequences:** The underdevelopment of grid infrastructure limited the full utilization of renewable energy and highlighted the importance of planning for future capacity needs.

**General Considerations**

- **Location matters:** ==OSW projects near existing grid infrastructure with sufficient capacity are more cost-effective to develop.== Building new transmission lines can be expensive and time-consuming.[expand_more](https://www.energy.gov/policy/queued-need-transmission)
- **Future planning:** As countries invest in OSW expansion, it's crucial to also invest in grid modernization and upgrades. This ensures that the clean energy generated can be efficiently transmitted to where it's needed.
