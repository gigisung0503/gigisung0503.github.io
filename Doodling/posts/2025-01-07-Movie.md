**Take This Waltz: Restlessness in Comfortable Love**

Sarah Polley’s second feature film, *Take This Waltz*, dives into the uneasy space between affection, routine, and longing. Whereas her debut, *Away From Her*, told the story of an older couple facing Alzheimer’s, *Take This Waltz* focuses on a younger marriage quietly slipping into dissatisfaction. The result is a candid look at how even a seemingly happy relationship can push someone to crave something thrilling and new.

### A Marriage of Familiar Routines

Margot (Michelle Williams) and Lou (Seth Rogen) appear to have a pleasant, easygoing life. He’s a cookbook writer immersed in developing chicken recipes; she’s bright and imaginative. Their shared comfort suggests they’re doing just fine—until Margot meets Daniel (Luke Kirby). His spontaneity electrifies something in her that routine and security just can’t touch.

### Symbolic Hints: Chicken and the Scrambler

Polley uses quiet symbols to capture Margot’s state of mind. Lou’s endless chicken experiments point to his sincere yet predictable approach to life—steadfast but lacking surprise. Meanwhile, the Scrambler ride at a fairground stands in for Margot’s chaotic, head-spinning attraction to Daniel. As fun as it looks, it’s easy to end up dizzy and disoriented, unsure whether the rush truly solves anything or just repeats a familiar pattern with a new face.

### Shifts in Perspective

Visually, Polley keeps us on our toes. Scenes that first appear to show Margot cooking for Lou might suddenly reveal she’s with Daniel instead, underlining how blurred the line can be between devotion and transgression. In one montage set to Leonard Cohen’s “Take This Waltz,” **we watch Margot and Daniel’s relationship unfold in a rush—from its magnetic start to its sobering shift back into routine.**

### A Troubling Question

**The core dilemma:** <em style="color: #355C7D;">Is Margot’s restlessness about her marriage or about her own inability to settle down?</em> Lou is not cruel or neglectful—he’s genuinely caring, even a bit playful. Yet his unwavering stability may be part of what makes Margot itch to break free. Polley never labels Margot’s desire as “wrong” or “right.” Instead, she shows how people can drift away from good partners, lured by the promise of excitement—only to wonder if they’ll end up right where they started.

### Why It Resonates

Ultimately, *Take This Waltz* shows how love can toggle between the comfort of the known and the spark of the unfamiliar. By the film’s end, there’s no tidy answer—only a reminder that longing can stem as much from within ourselves as it can from our circumstances. Polley leaves us reflecting on whether a new relationship is ever truly new, or if we keep recreating the same patterns in a different guise. It’s a thoughtful, lingering portrait of how the search for happiness might just circle back to the restlessness that sent us searching in the first place.

### A Personal Reflection

This film was a source of deep comfort for me. It also set me free from a lingering sense of guilt that had been weighing on me until quite recently. In my own past relationship, I was essentially in Lou’s position. From Margot’s perspective (or the director’s lens following Margot), Lou is portrayed as someone who values stability—almost to the point of seeming flat. I suspect that was a conscious choice in the film, a kind of cinematic compromise to underscore the contrast between Lou and Daniel.

Yet in my mind, Lou might be a far more sensitive soul than the film lets on. He could be the type who finds a sense of novelty in every small shift—whether it’s cooking chicken yet again or uttering the same “I love you” that others might find stale. Maybe those “boring” daily acts of affection felt fresh to Lou in subtle ways. Who knows? At least, that was my case.

Margot, however, seems to be tuned to a different frequency. To her, life with Lou feels like a cycle stuck on repeat, with no variation. Once Margot decides their marriage is “boring,” Lou’s every quality becomes monochromatic to her, as if she’s slipped a gray filter ovemr him. Interestingly, Daniel—Margot’s supposed alternative—turns out not to be the ideal she imagined. That part, oddly enough, gave me some solace.

I never truly learned why my own relationship had to end, though I suspect “boredom” was a major factor, and I ended up blaming myself for causing it. Seeing Margot’s endless restlessness hinted at in the film was a comfort. Realizing that someone like Margot—driven by impulses no one can fully quell—would struggle to find lasting contentment made me feel liberated. I may sound a bit twisted saying so. 

That being said, I'd like to discuss moral (or could be ehtical) considerations w relationships in my next post. Will share more soon.
