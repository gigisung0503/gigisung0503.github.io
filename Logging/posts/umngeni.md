# What is your impression of South Africa?

"So, what is your impression of South Africa so far?" </br></br>

This is the first question I get asked whenever I meet someone here in uMngeni. And I give the most unremarkable answer one could imagine: </br></br>

"Ahh, it's almost the same as the States." </br></br>

Then comes the confused look. They might think, "What is she talking about? South Africa is nothing like the States. She's Asian. She mustn't have been in America for that long." That’s a fair guess. I've lived in the States for two and a half years now. Boston, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle are the only cities I've visited.

Regardless, my argument remains the same. South Africa is almost the same as the States, and the rest of the "developing" world. The work of capital and the way of business are the same, hense the same look of development. You realize how true the word "globalization" is that you get a shiver. 

"Developing" countries, like South Africa, and South Korea a few decades ago, are burdened with obssesive imperative to close the gap with the "developed" world. The "developed" world fuel this obsession by providing loans, investments, and technologies. And they make sure that the "developing" countries are on the right track by dispatching their experts and consultants like me. 

Yeah. That is what I am doing. I am an embassador with a mission to implant the same protocols and business conventions as accepted by the "developed" world. At the end of this mission, a bigger, more efficient, and more profitable market with "educated" consumers awaits the "developed" world. 

I say this with a touch of sarcasm but without criticism. It is as natural as white ants expanding their colonies. There is no value judgment here. I don’t believe there’s an alternative way of being in this humanity. You either colonize or get colonized. You either set the rules or follow the rules. It is sad, though, that the "rules" are now the same everywhere.

Returning to the question, "What is your impression of South Africa?" You now understand how my answer makes sense. South Africa is almost the same as the States. It is a place where the same rules apply. It is a place where the same marathon is run. It's just that South Africa and our fellow once-colonized-and-now-developing countries are many steps behind.

"Then, what about humanitarian work?" You might ask, thinking that it is with noble cause, not hiding any insidious scheme behind, different from the "development missionary." I also acknowledge that a set of humanitarian inteventions is with impricable motive/value. But really, there is a fine line between humanitarian and development work in the field. Development gives access to water, electricity, and education, a better life. The time of execution is a differentiater. The results are the same.



# Indigent Policy Program

Now, that was a heavy introduction. You still do not know why I am in SA. I am here as a consultant hired by Harvard Bloomberg Cities Leadership Initiative. Within the timeline of 10 weeks, I investigate, diagnose, and prescribe a solution to the indigent policy program in uMngeni. May be that is too broad.
