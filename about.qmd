Hello, my name is Gigi Sung, and I am deeply invested in advancing urban analysis and planning through innovative technologies and equitable frameworks. As a graduate of the ***Harvard Graduate School of Design*** and a geospatial analyst at the ***World Health Organization***, I find myself at the nexus of cutting-edge research and impactful applications.

My passion is anchored in the use of ***spatial data science*** to navigate and resolve urban challenges, and I am particularly excited about the potential of machine learning and deep learning to transform urban planning. Consider the transformative capabilities of land use classification, building footprint extraction, and urban growth predictionâ€”these are just a few examples of how ml algorithms can redefine our understanding and planning of urban spaces. (***Of courese, we also constantly refer to statistical models***.)

In the realm of climate action, I am dedicated to exploring solutions in climate mitigation and adaptation, enhancing urban resilience, and fostering sustainable urban development. How can analytics serve us in these endeavors? We can turn to ***climate risk assessments, strategies to mitigate urban heat islands, and analyses to identify suitable locations for renewable energy infrastructure***, among others.

I also champion the cause of ***open data and open-source software***, believing firmly in their ability to democratize data science and make advanced analytics accessible to all.

A point of reflection in my journey is the ***balance between quantitative rigor and qualitative understanding***. I recognize that while technology and data can offer a robust basis for decision-making, they often face criticism for overlooking the qualitative nuances of phenomena. As a conscientious urban planner, my ambition is to cultivate a synthetic framework that integrates quantitative analysis with qualitative insights, whether on a personal scale or within a systematic approach. This balance ensures we remain critically aware and inclusive of the diverse aspects that characterize urban spaces, making our decisions not only data-driven but also empathetically informed.
